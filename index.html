        <h3>Bishkek city</h3>
        <p>Bishkek formerly Pishpek and Frunze, is the capital and largest city of Kyrgyzstan.
          Bishkek is also the administrative centre of the Chüy Region. The region surrounds the city, although the city itself
          is not part of the region but rather a region-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.</p>
